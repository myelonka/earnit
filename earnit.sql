We believe helping our clients gain confidence in their digital future is essential to their growth, and as a result our cyber security practice is one of the key growth priorities of our firm.\r\n\r\nWe are one of the largest cyber security specialist consulting practices in the UK, we work closely with the leading experts, researchers, tech vendors and government agencies in the field, and we serve some of the largest and most complex clients in the world.\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting time to be working cyber security, and nowhere more so than at PwC.\r\n\r\nOur Practice\r\n\r\nOur cyber security practice operates nationally, and serves clients holistically with both strategy, risk and governance advice, and with deep technical implementation and assurance expertise. We have over 200 practitioners who range from business risk advisors who work with CEOs, CFOs and boards, to deep technical SMEs who help clients implement controls to secure their businesses from attack, and support them to respond when an attack occurs.\r\n\r\nOur career models recognise both, and give our people the opportunity to be challenged and to develop whatever their chosen cyber specialism.\r\n\r\nOur team helps clients to understand their cyber risks and define and execute a strategy which enables the business to deliver its objectives within their desired risk envelope. We support client leadership teams to define their risk appetite and a proportionate target state of cyber capability and maturity to deliver it; we define operating and governance models to make cyber security a sustainable capability which responds to evolving business priorities. We also help clients define and assure complex control solutions to help them manage their risks.\r\n\r\nThe Role\r\n\r\nThe Cyber Security Manager provides expert strategy, risk and technical advice, guidance and support on cyber security, both in business-as-usual and for live and planned projects within our clients’ business.\r\n\r\nYou will have a broad range of cyber and information security skills, knowledge and experience, perhaps underpinned by a deeper SME in one of our key advisory practice areas (see www.pwc.co.uk/cyber).

Whichever of these describes you, you will be developing a strong track record of credibility as a trusted advisor to senior business stakeholders on cyber secuity, and you must be experienced and comfortable working with stakeholders up CxO level in FTSE350-scale companies.\r\n\r\nLocations: we have major cyber practice hubs in six major cities across the UK, but these roles are based in London\r\n\r\nIn return we offer:\r\n\r\nVariety - An impressive list of clients with different needs and issues at both a technical and strategic level.\r\nOpportunity - To develop your technical and business skills and enhance your business advisory, presentational and inter-personal skills.\r\nSupport - We work as a team and support each other on a day-to-day basis.
